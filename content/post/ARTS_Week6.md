#### How to understand a topic?
- Understand big picture, read source code. 
- You must write code to be fully understand it in and out.
- Knowing a concept and reading some articles are not enough. You need to have an implementation level of understanding. It will then live inside your brain forever and become part of your knowledge.

#### How to read source code?
- You don’t read source code arbitrary, you come up with questions and wonder how it works in certain way. 
- You search the answers in source code.
- Once you found out the solution to your questions, you understand the system, and how it works deeply.
- You summarize what you found in blog.
- You explain this cool thing to your friends, your wife/husband. You might find some missing pieces while answering questions from them.
- Lastly, you wrote your implementation to demonstrate this idea.
